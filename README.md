# AS-simulator:

This is personal project to simulate the summon/recruitment mechanics of Alchemy Stars (AS) the mobile game.

In this project I attemp to capture the uncertainties of recruitment in AS. The best summon outcome is a tier 6 (star) hero. A lucky individual might roll 5+ six star heroes in just 50 rolls, while someone less fortunate might take 90 rolls just to get one six star hero.

Have you ever wonder what you can get if you saved up for 100 summons? Or how much do you need to save to be guaranteed a feature hero? 
By simulating several (tens/hundreds of thousands of) alternate universes or alternate accounts wethese questions can be answered.

The codes are written in R v4.1.0.
